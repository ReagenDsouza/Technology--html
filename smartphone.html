      A smartphone is a mobile phone with advanced computing capabilities. It
      typically has a touchscreen interface, allowing users to access a wide
      range of applications and services, such as web browsing, email, and
      social media, as well as multimedia playback and streaming. Smartphones
      have built-in cameras, GPS navigation, and support for various
      communication methods, including voice calls, text messaging, and
      internet-based messaging apps. Smartphones are distinguished from
      older-design feature phones by their more advanced hardware capabilities
      and extensive mobile operating systems, access to the internet, business
      applications, mobile payments, and multimedia functionality, including
      music, video, gaming, radio, and television. <br /><br />
      Smartphones typically feature metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated
      circuit (IC) chips, various sensors, and support for multiple wireless
      communication protocols. Examples of smartphone sensors include
      accelerometers, barometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers; they can be
      used by both pre-installed and third-party software to enhance
      functionality. Wireless communication standards supported by smartphones
      include LTE, 5G NR, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and satellite navigation. By the
      mid-2020s, manufacturers began integrating satellite messaging and
      emergency services, expanding their utility in remote areas without
      reliable cellular coverage. Smartphones have largely replaced personal
      digital assistant (PDA) devices, handheld/palm-sized PCs, portable media
      players (PMP),point-and-shoot cameras, camcorders, and, to a lesser
      extent, handheld video game consoles, e-reader devices, pocket
      calculators, and GPS tracking units.<br /><br />
      Following the rising popularity of the iPhone in the late 2000s, the
      majority of smartphones have featured thin, slate-like form factors with
      large, capacitive touch screens with support for multi-touch gestures
      rather than physical keyboards. Most modern smartphones have the ability
      for users to download or purchase additional applications from a
      centralized app store. They often have support for cloud storage and cloud
      synchronization, and virtual assistants. Since the early 2010s, improved
      hardware and faster wireless communication have bolstered the growth of
      the smartphone industry. As of 2014, over a billion smartphones are sold
      globally every year. In 2019 alone, 1.54 billion smartphone units were
      shipped worldwide. As of 2020, 75.05 percent of the world population were
      smartphone users. </font
