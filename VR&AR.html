      Augmented reality (AR), also known as mixed reality (MR), is a technology
      that overlays real-time 3D-rendered computer graphics onto a portion of
      the real world through a display, such as a handheld device or
      head-mounted display. This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the
      physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the
      real environment.In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing
      perception of a real-world environment, compared to virtual reality, which
      aims to completely replace the user's real-world environment with a
      simulated one.Augmented reality is typically visual, but can span multiple
      sensory modalities, including auditory, haptic, and somatosensory.The
      primary value of augmented reality is the manner in which components of a
      digital world blend into a person's perception of the real world, through
      the integration of immersive sensations, which are perceived as real in
      the user's environment. The earliest functional AR systems that provided
      immersive mixed reality experiences for users were invented in the early
      1990s, starting with the Virtual Fixtures system developed at the U.S. Air
      Force's Armstrong Laboratory in 1992. Commercial augmented reality
      experiences were first introduced in entertainment and gaming
      businesses.Subsequently, augmented reality applications have spanned
      industries such as education, communications, medicine, and
      entertainment.<br /><br />

      Augmented reality can be used to enhance natural environments or
      situations and offers perceptually enriched experiences. With the help of
      advanced AR technologies (e.g. adding computer vision, incorporating AR
      cameras into smartphone applications, and object recognition) the
      information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes
      interactive and digitally manipulated.Information about the environment
      and its objects is overlaid on the real world. This information can be
      virtual or real, e.g. seeing other real sensed or measured information
      such as electromagnetic radio waves overlaid in exact alignment with where
      they actually are in space.Augmented reality also has a lot of potential
      in the gathering and sharing of tacit knowledge. Immersive perceptual
      information is sometimes combined with supplemental information like
      scores over a live video feed of a sporting event. This combines the
      benefits of both augmented reality technology and heads up display
      technology (HUD).<br /><br />

      Augmented reality frameworks include ARKit and ARCore. Commercial
      augmented reality headsets include the Magic Leap 1 and HoloLens. A number
      of companies have promoted the concept of smartglasses that have augmented
      reality capability. Augmented reality can be defined as a system that
      incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual
      worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and
      real objects.The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e.
      additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the
      natural environment).As such, it is one of the key technologies in the
      reality-virtuality continuum.Augmented reality is largely synonymous with
      mixed reality. There is also overlap in terminology with extended reality
      and computer-mediated reality.

      Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that employs 3D near-eye
      displays and pose tracking to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual
      world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (particularly
      video games), education (such as medical, safety, or military training)
      and business (such as virtual meetings). VR is one of the key technologies
      in the reality-virtuality continuum. As such, it is different from other
      digital visualization solutions, such as augmented virtuality and
      augmented reality.<br><br>
      Currently, standard virtual reality systems use
      either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to
      generate some realistic images, sounds, and other sensations that simulate
      a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using
      virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world,
      move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect
      is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display
      with a small screen in front of the eyes but can also be created through
      specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality
      typically incorporates auditory and video feedback but may also allow
      other types of sensory and force feedback through haptic technology.
