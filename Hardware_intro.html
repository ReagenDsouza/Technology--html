      Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the
      central processing unit (CPU), random-access memory (RAM), motherboard,
      computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, and computer case. It
      includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and
      speakers.By contrast, software is a set of written instructions
      that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware derived its name from the
      fact it is hard or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is soft
      because it is easy to change. Hardware is typically directed by the
      software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware
      and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist
      with only hardware.
