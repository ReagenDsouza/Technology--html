      Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the
      head over a user's ears. They are electroacoustic transducers, which
      convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones let a
      single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a
      loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to
      hear. Headphones are also known as earphones or, colloquially, cans.
      Circumaural (around the ear) and supra-aural (over the ear) headphones use
      a band over the top of the head to hold the drivers in place. Another
      type, known as earbuds or earpieces, consists of individual units that
      plug into the user's ear canal; within that category have been developed
      cordless air buds using wireless technology. A third type are bone
      conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head
      and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open.
      <br /><br />
      In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of a
      headphone and microphone. Headphones connect to a signal source such as an
      audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone,
      video game console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly
      using a cord, or using wireless technology such as Bluetooth, DECT or FM
      radio. The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for
      use by switchboard operators, to keep their hands free. Initially, the
      audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of high
      fidelity headphones.Headphones exhibit a range of different audio
      reproduction quality capabilities. Headsets designed for telephone use
      typically cannot reproduce sound with the high fidelity of expensive units
      designed for music listening by audiophiles. <br /><br />
      Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) or
      1⁄8 inch (3.2 mm) phone jack for plugging the headphones into the audio
      source. Some headphones are wireless, using Bluetooth connectivity to
      receive the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like
      cellphones and digital players.As a result of the Walkman effect,
      beginning in the 1980s, headphones started to be used in public places
      such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit.[6] Headphones are
      also used by people in various professional contexts, such as audio
      engineers mixing sound for live concerts or sound recordings and disc
      jockeys (DJs), who use headphones to cue up the next song without the
      audience hearing, aircraft pilots and call center employees. The latter
      two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone. </font
