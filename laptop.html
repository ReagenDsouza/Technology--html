      A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or
      notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically
      have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the
      upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside
      of the lower lid.Most of the computer's internal hardware is in the lower
      part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in
      webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen
      display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile
      operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which
      were originally developed for desktop computers.<br /><br />
      Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on
      business trips), in education, for playing games, content creating, web
      browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use. They
      can run on both AC power and rechargable battery packs and can be folded
      shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for
      mobile use.Laptops combine essentially the same input/output components
      and capabilities of a desktop computer into a single unit, including a
      display screen (usually 11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size), small
      speakers, a keyboard, and a pointing device (usually touchpads). Hardware
      specifications may vary significantly between different types, models, and
      price points. <br /><br />
      The word laptop, modeled after the term desktop (as in desktop computer),
      refers to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on the
      user's lap; while the word notebook refers to most laptops being
      approximately similar in size to a paper notebook. As of 2024, in American
      English, the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably;in other
      dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred.The term notebook
      originally referred to a type of portable computer that was smaller and
      lighter than mainstream laptops of the time, but has since come to mean
      the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size. <br /><br />
      Design elements, form factors, and construction can also vary
      significantly between models depending on the intended use. Examples of
      specialized models of laptops include 2-in-1 laptops, with keyboards that
      either be detached or pivoted out of view from the display (often marketed
      having a "laptop mode"), and rugged laptops, for use in construction or
      military applications. Portable computers, which later developed into
      modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small niche market,
      mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for
      accountants, or travelling sales representatives. As portable computers
      evolved into modern laptops, they became widely used for a variety of
      purposes.
