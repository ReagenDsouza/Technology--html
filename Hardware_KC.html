    <h2 style="color: red">Motherboard</h2>
    <br />
    <font size="4">
      A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard, system
      board, baseboard, planar board or logic board). It's the main printed
      circuit board (PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other
      expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the
      crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing
      unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.
      Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems
      such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory
      controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for
      general purpose use. Motherboard specifically refers to a PCB with
      expansion capability and as the name suggests, this board is often
      referred to as the "mother" of all components attached to it, which often
      include peripherals, interface cards, and daughtercards: sound cards,
      video cards, network cards, hard drives, or other forms of persistent
      storage; TV tuner cards, cards providing extra USB or FireWire slots and a
      variety of other custom components. Similarly, the term mainboard is
      applied to devices with a single board and no additional expansions or
      capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers, televisions,
      washing machines and other embedded systems with limited expansion
      abilities. </font

    <h2 style="color: red">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
    <br />
    <font size="4">
      A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main
      processor, or just processor, is the primary processor in a given
      computer.Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer
      program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O)
      operations.This role contrasts with that of external components, such as
      main memory and I/O circuitry,and specialized coprocessors such as
      graphics processing units (GPUs). The form, design, and implementation of
      CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains
      almost unchanged.Principal components of a CPU include the
      arithmetic–logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations,
      processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results
      of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from
      memory), decoding and execution (of instructions) by directing the
      coordinated operations of the ALU, registers, and other components.<br /><br />
      Modern CPUs devote a lot of semiconductor area to caches and
      instruction-level parallelism to increase performance and to CPU modes to
      support operating systems and virtualization. Most modern CPUs are
      implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more
      CPUs on a single IC chip. Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are
      called multi-core processors.The individual physical CPUs, called
      processor cores, can also be multithreaded to support CPU-level
      multithreading. An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory,
      peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer;such integrated
      devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC). </font

    <h2 style="color: red">Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
    <br />
    <font size="4">
      A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit
      designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics,
      being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards,
      mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. GPUs
      were later found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving
      embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. The
      ability of GPUs to rapidly perform vast numbers of calculations has led to
      their adoption in diverse fields including artificial intelligence (AI)
      where they excel at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding
      tasks. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks
      and cryptocurrency mining. </font

    <h2 style="color: red">Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
    <br />
    <font size="4">
      Random-access memory (RAM; /ræm/) is a form of electronic computer memory
      that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working
      data and machine code.A random-access memory device allows data items to
      be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the
      physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other
      direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks and magnetic tape),
      where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly
      depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to
      mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.
      <br /><br />
      In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated
      circuit (IC) chips with MOS (metal–oxide–semiconductor) memory cells. RAM
      is normally associated with volatile types of memory where stored
      information is lost if power is removed. The two main types of volatile
      random-access semiconductor memory are static random-access memory (SRAM)
      and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Non-volatile RAM has also been
      developed and other types of non-volatile memories allow random access for
      read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other
      kinds of limitations. These include most types of ROM and NOR flash
      memory. The use of semiconductor RAM dates back to 1965 when IBM
      introduced the monolithic (single-chip) 16-bit SP95 SRAM chip for their
      System/360 Model 95 computer, and Toshiba used bipolar DRAM memory cells
      for its 180-bit Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, both based on
      bipolar transistors. While it offered higher speeds than magnetic-core
      memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the
      then-dominant magnetic-core memory. In 1966, Dr. Robert Dennard invented
      modern DRAM architecture in which there's a single MOS transistor per
      capacitor.The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the 1K Intel 1103, was
      introduced in October 1970. Synchronous dynamic random-access memory
      (SDRAM) was reintroduced with the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in 1992. </font

    <h2 style="color: red">Storage device</h2>
    <br />
    <font size="4">
      A storage device is a piece of hardware that is used to store and retrieve
      digital information. There are many different types of storage devices,
      including hard drives, solid-state drives, USB drives, and memory cards.
      Storage devices work by saving digital data to a physical medium, such as
      a spinning disk or a chip. This data can then be retrieved and accessed by
      a computer or other device when needed. Storage devices are an essential
      component of any computer system, as they provide a place to store and
      access the operating system, programs, and files that are used by the
      system. They also play a key role in backing up and preserving important
      data, as they provide a way to store and retrieve data even if the
      computer itself is not operational. There are many different factors to
      consider when selecting a storage device, including capacity, performance,
      reliability, and cost. Different types of storage devices are suitable for
      different needs, and the right storage device will depend on the specific
      requirements of the system or application it is being used for.
