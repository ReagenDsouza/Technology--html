      A video game console is an electronic device that outputs a video signal
      or image to display a video game that can typically be played with a game
      controller. These may be home consoles, which are generally placed in a
      permanent location connected to a television or other display devices and
      controlled with a separate game controller, or handheld consoles, which
      include their own display unit and controller functions built into the
      unit and which can be played anywhere. Hybrid consoles combine elements of
      both home and handheld consoles. <br /><br />
      Video game consoles are a specialized form of home computer geared towards
      video game playing, designed with affordability and accessibility to the
      general public in mind, but lacking in raw computing power and
      customization. Simplicity is achieved in part through the use of game
      cartridges or other simplified methods of distribution, easing the effort
      of launching a game. However, this leads to ubiquitous proprietary formats
      that create competition for market share.[1] More recent consoles have
      shown further confluence with home computers, making it easy for
      developers to release games on multiple platforms. Further, modern
      consoles can serve as replacements for media players with capabilities to
      play films and music from optical media or streaming media services.
      <br /><br />
      Video game consoles are usually sold on a fiveâ€“seven year cycle called a
      generation, with consoles made with similar technical capabilities or made
      around the same time period grouped into one generation. The industry has
      developed a razor and blades model: manufacturers often sell consoles at
      low prices, sometimes at a loss, while primarily making a profit from the
      licensing fees for each game sold. Planned obsolescence then draws
      consumers into buying the next console generation. While numerous
      manufacturers have come and gone in the history of the console market,
      there have always been two or three dominant leaders in the market, with
      the current market led by Sony (with their PlayStation brand), Microsoft
      (with their Xbox brand), and Nintendo (currently producing the Switch
      console). Previous console developers include Sega, Atari, Coleco, Mattel,
      NEC, SNK, Magnavox, Philips and Panasonic. </font
