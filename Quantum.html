      A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical
      phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both
      particles and waves, and quantum computing takes advantage of this
      behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the
      operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could
      perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern
      "classical" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could
      break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing
      physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely
      experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful
      applications. The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the
      qubit (or "quantum bit"), serves the same function as the bit in classical
      computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two
      states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two "basis"
      states, a state that is in an abstract sense "between" the two basis
      states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a
      classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular
      way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement
      results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures
      that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and
      quickly.<br><br>
      Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world
      applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be
      challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its
      environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into
      calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental
      research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times
      and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors
      (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance)
      and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using
      electromagnetic fields). In principle, a classical computer can solve the
      same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time.
      Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than
      computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum
      algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best-known classical
      algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve
      computational problems that are not solvable within a reasonable timeframe
      for a classical computer. This concept of additional ability has been
      called "quantum supremacy". While such claims have drawn significant
      attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited.
